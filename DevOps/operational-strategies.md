<h2> Operational Strategies in DevOps: </h2>

Building Operational Strategies

Course’s aim: The key areas for developing and building a solid operation strategy for the environment.

- challenges for building a strategy
- dig into the reliability stack
- address key areas of observability 
- automation and the platform team model

By the end I will the knowledge how to build an operational strategy and how to apply it to your environment.


Main topics: SRE, Observability and Automation

- traditional monitoring
- different demands

Mega Trends:
- new technologies and new problems;
- disconnected metrics;
- new tools and hops for complexity;
- silo issues: developers;
- silo issues: operations;

Landscape Challenges:
- the predictable legacy application;
- application logging and coarse system-level metrics;
- less complexity and instinctual techniques;
- creative ways to fail;

Issues with Traditional Monitoring:
- monolithic application: anticipate the failures;
- monolithic application: reactive approach;
- can’t predict a modern system;
- unpredictable failures;



Metric-based approach to monitoring:
- predictable failure modes;
- issues with metrics;
- lack of connective event;
- user experience;
- static thresholds;
- SLO, SLI and Error Budgets;

Key Wins:
- service level management components – objective and indicators;


DevOps Automation:
- the value of automation;
- DevOps Tooling;
- Automated Testing;
- Comprehensive Pipelines;
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC);
- Secure the DevOps Workflow;

Striving for Observability:
- Highlighting Observability;
- Application Interaction;
- Monitoring and Observability;

We have 3 pillars of observability: metrics, traces and logs.

Striving for Reliability:
- It’s all about Trust;
- Measure User experience


Reliability Stack:
- Service Level indicator (SLI);
- Service Level Objective (SLO);
- Error Budget;

Risk Analysis:
- Configuration problem;
- Regional failure;
- spike in traffic;
- resource problem;
	Gaining and Measuring Reliability:

Highlighting Reliability:
- the most important feature is reliability;
- chaos engineering;
- service consistency;
- metrics to care about;
- cause of outrages;
- velocity and stability;

Reliability Key Considerations:
- the user is the most important, a.k.a. ‘king’
- user perception;
- failures are ok;
- systems will fail;
- being 100% reliable isn’t what we aim for;
- SLO-based approach;

DevOps and SRE:
- reduce organizational silos;
- accept failure as normal;
- implement gradual changes;
- leverage tooling and automation;
- measure everything;

** DevOps:
- reduce silos;
- accept failure as normal;
- gradual changes;
- leverage automation;
- measure everything;
- baselines;

** Site Reliability Engineer (SRE):
- stands between traditional IT and software development;

SRE Principles and Practices:
- Metrics and Monitoring;
- Observability;
- Capacity Planning;
- Change Management;
- Emergency and Incident Response;
- Post-mortem;
- Culture;

	Striving for Observability

- Pillars of Observability: Metrics, Traces and Logs
- Monitoring and Observability
- Tools available


Key Considerations:
- no predicts in advance;
- monitoring tools: we need one tool;
- monitoring and observability combined;
