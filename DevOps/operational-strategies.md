<h2> Building Operational Strategies </h2>

<p> Aim for this section: Learn the key areas for developing and building a solid operation strategy for the environment. </p>

* `challenges for building a strategy`
* `dig into the reliability stack`
* `address key areas of observability`
* `automation and the platform team model`

<p> Mega Trends: </p>

* `new technologies and new problems;`
* `disconnected metrics;`
* `new tools and hops for complexity;`
* `silo issues: developers;`
* `silo issues: operations;`

<p> Landscape Challenges: </p>

* `the predictable legacy application;`
* `application logging and coarse system-level metrics;`
* `less complexity and instinctual techniques;`
* `creative ways to fail;`

<p> Issues with Traditional Monitoring: </p>

* `monolithic application: anticipate the failures;`
* `monolithic application: reactive approach;`
* `can’t predict a modern system;`
* `unpredictable failures;`

<p> Metric-based approach to monitoring: </p>

* `predictable failure modes;`
* `issues with metrics;`
* `lack of connective event;`
* `user experience;`
* `static thresholds;`
* `SLO, SLI and Error Budgets;`

<p> Key Wins: </p>

* `service level management components – objective and indicators;`
<p> DevOps Automation: </p>

* `the value of automation;`
* `DevOps Tooling;`
* `Automated Testing;`
* `Comprehensive Pipelines;`
* `Infrastructure as Code (IaC);`
* `Secure the DevOps Workflow;`

<p> Striving for Observability: </p>

* `Highlighting Observability;`
* `Application Interaction;`
* `Monitoring and Observability;`

<p> We have 3 pillars of observability: metrics, traces and logs. </p>

<p> Striving for Reliability: it’s all about Trust and measuring user experience. </p>


<p> Reliability Stack: </p>

* `Service Level indicator (SLI);`
* `Service Level Objective (SLO);`
* `Error Budget;`

<p> Risk Analysis: </p>

* `Configuration problem;`
* `Regional failure;`
* `spike in traffic;`
* `resource problem;`
  
<h2> Gaining and Measuring Reliability: </h2>

<p> Highlighting Reliability: </p>

* `the most important feature is reliability;`
* `chaos engineering;`
* `service consistency;`
* `metrics to care about;`
* `cause of outrages;`
* `velocity and stability;`

<p> Reliability Key Considerations: </p>

* `the user is the most important, a.k.a. ‘king’`
* `user perception;`
* `failures are ok;`
* `systems will fail;`
* `being 100% reliable isn’t what we aim for;`
* `SLO-based approach;`

<p> DevOps and SRE: </p>

* `reduce organizational silos;`
* `accept failure as normal;`
* `implement gradual changes;`
* `leverage tooling and automation;`
* `measure everything;`

<p> DevOps: </p>

* `reduce silos;`
* `accept failure as normal;`
* `gradual changes;`
* `leverage automation;`
* `measure everything;`
* `baselines;`

<p> Site Reliability Engineer as a position stands between traditional IT and software development. </p>

<p> SRE Principles and Practices: </p>

* `Metrics and Monitoring;`
* `Observability;`
* `Capacity Planning;`
* `Change Management;`
* `Emergency and Incident Response;`
* `Post-mortem;`
* `Culture;`

<h2> Striving for Observability </h2>

* `Pillars of Observability: Metrics, Traces and Logs`
* `Monitoring and Observability`
* `Tools available`


<p> Key Considerations: </p>

* `no predicts in advance;`
* `monitoring tools: we need one tool;`
* `monitoring and observability combined;`

<p> Metrics and dashboards is a very reactive approach. Observability is a proactive approach. </p>

Monitoring and Observability:
- monitoring is best combined with Observability
- monitoring the infrastructure
- monitoring the software

Building Observability:

Pillars of Observability:
- traces – transaction oriented observability
- logs – event-orientated observability
- metrics – they are precise

Distributed Tracing – Service Mesh – tool to use

Observability is about giving the right information to the right people.


Starting Considerations;
- Good quality telemetry;
- Data storage and analytics;

	The role of Automation

Service Pain Points:
- design and build
- operate and maintain

Ways to Improve:
- DevOps and Agile
- Automation
- Comprehensive Pipelines
- AIOps Platforms – there are 2 main components for a AIOp platform – Big Data and Machine Learning;
- Container Management
- Team Models

Automation in the CI/CD Pipeline:
- highlighting CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- CI/CD Tools – Jenkins, GitLab
Building the DevOps Flow:
- GitLab Continuous Integration
- The Deployment Flow
- GitLab Continuous Delivery
- Post Deployment Validation
- Infrastructure Testing, System Testing and Application Testing

Application Testing:
- Smoke Tests
- Functional Regressions Tests
- End-to-end Test

Release Deployment Strategies:
- Big Bang;
- Rolling Deployment;
- Blue-Green Deployment;
- Canary Deployment;

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- Infrastructure as Code – Terraform Scripts and templates, policies; Terraform
- IaC Tools – Terraform, Puppet;
- Benefits of IaC;

Security in the CI/CD Pipeline:
- Application Security;
- Static Analysis;
- Dynamic Analysis;
- Dependent Scanning;
- Infrastructure Security;
- Security Tools;
