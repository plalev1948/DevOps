<h2> Planning and Implementing a DevOps Strategy </h2>

<p> Topics to consider: </p>

* `Defining DevOps`
* `What Not to do`
* `Is DevOps worth it?`
* `Analyzing your company`
* `Analyzing your people`
* `Analyzing your value streams`

<p> Do not do these things when starting DevOps: </p>

* `buy lots of new software;`
* `rename your teams;`
* `force change on everyone;`
* `define rigorous standards;`
* `ask Ops to lead the change;`
* `copy latest KubeCon speaker;`

<p> Pros when using DevOps: </p>

* `faster throughput – more frequent deployments, shorter lead times;`
* `more stability – lower change failure rate, faster recovery time;`
* `positive org impcat;`

<p> Determine the Organization’s Priorities: </p>

* `look at declared goals and OKRs;`
* `recognize business opportunities and challenges;`
* `interview a wide array of teams;`

<p> List Methodologies and Practices in Place; </p>

* `how do we design and develop software;`
* `who creates tests and when do we test;`
* `do we fund projects or products;`
* `how do we use source control management;`
* `how do we configure and update infrastructure;`
* `how do we package, store and deploy software;`

<p> Build an Inventory of Current Tech Investments: </p>

* `planning and collaboration tools;`
* `development and build solutions;`
* `automation capabilities;`
* `change and release systems;`
* `runtime platforms;`
* `logging and monitoring systems;`

<p> Recognize Drivers of Change Management: </p>

* `identify who rolls out company changes;`
* `invest in communications and training;`
* `review past programs and what worked and didn't;`

<h3> Starting The DevOps Pilot </h3>

<p> Challenges you face when adopting DevOps: </p>

* `missing skills;`
* `unclear goals;`
* `incompatible processes;`
* `cultural mismatch;`
* `resistance to change;`
* `lack of leadership;`

<p> What to Prove in Your DevOps Pilot: </p>

* `impact can be measured through customer satisfaction;`
* `product teams can regularly deliver working software to production using automation;`
* `it’s possible to introduce durable cultural improvements to the organization;`

<p> Orienting Around Small Batches, Visual Systems and Continuous Delivery: </p>

* `aim to identify and deliver small batches of work;`
* `make work (items, builds, progress, metrics) visible;`
* `continuous delivery applies to all software delivery;`
* `practices, not tools, drive continuous delivery;`

<p> A DevOps Approach to Version Control: </p>

* `the root of many DevOps practices starts in version control;`
* `trunk-based development preferred to feature branches;`
* `automated tests, sync code reviews needed for trunk-based success;`
* `use version control for a wide range of artifacts;`

<p> Tackling the Integration and Delivery Pipeline; </p>

* `look at value stream and bottlenecks across the pipeline;`
* `add test coverage to code and continuous build/integration;`
* `introduce artifact and package management;`
* `invest in release automation for infrastructure and apps;`

<h3> Building and Sustaining DevOps Momentum: </h3>

<p> Challenges You Face When Scaling DevOps: </p>

* `working with legacy systems and tools;`
* `scaling practices in the organization;`
* `optimizing the delivery pipeline;`
* `overcoming a change-resistant culture;`
* `coordinating across more teams;`
* `acquiring broader funding and stakeholders;`


<p> Skills Learned in the Pilot That Must Scale: </p>

* `making work visible;`
* `working in agile and small batches;`
* `automating the path to production;`
* `using version control for a die set of assets;`
* `setting up infrastructure automation;`
* `tracking metrics that matter;`
* `adopting a continuous improvement mindset;`
* `taking ownership of the product lifecycle;`

<p> Patterns for Filling the Skills Gap: </p>

* `proactive training plans;`
* `communities of practice;`
* `rotation through the pilot team;`
* `hiring specific roles;`
* `templates for key activities;`
* `adopting a learning culture;`

<p> Choosing Tech and Processes to Standardize On: </p>

* `programming and scripting languages;`
* `issue tracking system;`
* `cloud and infrastructure platforms;`
* `logging and monitoring services;`
* `collaboration, web conference and chat tools;`
* `demo days, ops reviews, product strategy sessions;`

<p> The Purpose of a Platform Team: </p>

* `scale product teams by offering self-service and programmable infrastructure and delivery services;`
* `avoid the need for “full stack” product teams that make isolated choices that limit flexibility and increase long-term cost;`

<p> What it means to Shift left on Security: </p>

* `about integrating security into the process sooner;`
* `requires a change in culture, tooling and approach;`
* `“shift left’ versus “shift right”`

<p> How to Shift Left on Security in your Teams: </p>

* `Offer tailored training for each role;`
* `integrate security tolling into the developer toolchain;`
* `introduce new automated steps into CI pipelines;`
* `upgrade platforms and services, including secrets management;`
* `produce version controlled infrastructure templates;`
* `empower the team to “stop the line” for security concerns;`

<p> Increasing your chances of Sustained Success: </p>

* `maintain a customer focus;`
* `keep developing your stakeholders;`
* `build communities of practice and advance your craft;`
* `champion continuous improvement across skills, processes and technology;`
